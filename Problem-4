/*An election is contested by 5 candidates. The candidates are numbered 1 to 5
and the voting is done by marking the candidate number on the ballot paper.
Develop an application to read the ballots and count the votes cast for each
candidate using an array variable count. In case, a number read is outside the
range 1 to 5, the ballot should be considered as a 'spoilt ballot' and the program
should also count the number of spoilt ballots*/
